# Musicgo Application
Musicgo Application for INF 151

## Introduction
Our project idea is to create a music suggestion website that will integrate with Spotify’s API to recommend music and artists in a fun and unique way. We want to make it easy for people to find their next favorite song/artist.
Through the use of Spotify’s robust API, our users will be able to login with their Spotify accounts and get recommended playlists, songs, and more based on music and artists they already listen to. An additional, unique feature of our product would be filtering for lesser known artists as many music listeners appreciate discovering new artists.
